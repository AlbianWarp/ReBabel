# ReBabel

This Project aims for a better understanding and a reimplementation of the NetBabel Protocoll.

## What is NetBabel

[NetBabel (or Babel)](https://creatures.wiki/NetBabel) is the networking protocol used by [Creatures Docking Station](https://creatures.wiki/Docking_Station). While the protocol is not entirely understood, it involves transmitting [PRAY](https://creatures.wiki/PRAY) data between clients and a central server.
